# AMS Analysis and Functions

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing and modeling various datasets using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization functionalities.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Tools to clean, encode, and scale data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - PCA with Clustering (Gaussian Mixture Models, KMeans)
- **Outlier Detection**: Implements Cook's distance, Mahalanobis distance, and MCD-based Mahalanobis distance.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Trimmed k-means, t-Clust, and Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD).
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides accuracy and AUC metrics for trained models.
- **Visualization**:
  - Explained variance for PCA
  - Cluster visualizations for KMeans and Gaussian Mixture Models
  - Comparison of model performance metrics

## Files

- **functions.py**: A collection of functions for data processing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.
- **AMS_final.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook illustrating the application of functions from `functions.py` with detailed examples and analysis.
